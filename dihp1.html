                </p>
                <p>DAILY IN HIS PRESENCE</p>
                <p>DATE: TUESDAY 30TH AUGUST 2022</p></strong>
                <p><strong>TOPIC: WHO SHALL I BE AFRAID OF?</strong></p>
                <p><strong>TEXT: </strong>PSALM 27: 7-14</p>
                <p><strong>MEMORY VERSE: </strong>Wait for the LORD be strong, and let your heart take courage; wait for the LORD! Psalm 27:14.</p>
                <p>David was a man who fought series of battles in his life but the battles that scared him most are those that have to do with his fellow country man.</p>
                <p>Recall unending battles with Saul the jealous king. <br>
                    How about the one he fought against Absalom his son? <br>
                    He was never afraid of fighting the enemies outside but the enemies inside gave him the bitters. <br>
                    This song is written against enemies like that. <br>
                    If you are going through similar situation, you have a friend in David. <br>
                </p>
                <p>You can use this psalm to pray to God for deliverance anytime it seems your enemies are having an upper hand over your life. <br>
                    The Psalm is a psalm of faith in God who is your Creator, the stronghold of your life. <br>
                    See, anytime evildoers assail you, uttering slanders against you, they shall stumble and fall. He will hide you in the day of trouble and no evil will befall you.
                    Let faith in God soar in your heart. Let your faith see God on your side in the battle against your foes. 
                    Let God lead the battle against your avowed enemies. You will never be defeated. Victory is yours in Jesus name.</p>
                    <p>The battle is not yours in the first place, it's the Lords. You will only look on to see the recompense of the wicked.
                    Those whose faith are unshaken have always been victorious. Yours will not be an exception in Jesus Christ name.</p>
                </p>
                <p> <strong>CHALLENGE: </strong>Your enemies cannot do anything against you, just stay in God.
                 <p><strong>PRAYER: </strong>Here am l O Lord, deliver me from the clutches of my enemies in Jesus Christ name.</p>
                    
                   <p><strong>SHALOM.</strong></p> 
                   <p><strong> AYO NI O.</strong></p>
